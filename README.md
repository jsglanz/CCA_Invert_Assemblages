# Mobile_invertebrate_assemblages_assocated_with_a_structurally-complex_crustose_coralline_alga
Code and output from Chapter 1 of my Master's thesis titled "Mobile fauna associated with the tropical, branch-forming crustose coralline alga, Lithophyllum kotschyanum."

Folders include:

-Map: Contains script files to create maps of collection sites on the northeast shore of Moorea, French Polynesia. The color of points denotes the water flow environment characterizing each site, high water flow (red) and low water flow (orange).

-Assemblage analysis: Contains script files to rank and analyze the effects of three known drivers (water flow, algal partial mortality, and algal morphology, including interstitial volume, thallus rugosity, and branch density) to functional composition of associated assemblages. In this study, functional groups were based on average body size and the strategy each phylum employs to grasp onto surfaces since this can affect their flow tolerance and habitat selection.
